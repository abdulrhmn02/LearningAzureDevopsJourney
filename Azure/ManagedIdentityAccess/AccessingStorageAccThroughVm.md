# Azure VM and Storage Account Connection Setup

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to create an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) and connect it to an Azure Storage Account using managed identities for secure access.

## Prerequisites
- An Azure account with the necessary permissions to create resources.

## Steps

1. **Create a Resource Group**
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Create a new resource group.

2. **Create a Storage Account**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to "Create a resource" > "Storage" > "Storage account".
   - Choose the resource group created in the previous step.
   - Configure the required settings and create the storage account.

3. **Create a Container**
   - Inside your storage account, go to the "Containers" section.
   - Create a new container and upload your `index.html` file.

4. **Create a Virtual Machine**
   - Go to "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Virtual Machine".
   - Choose the same resource group and configure the VM settings.

5. **Enable Managed Identity**
   - After the VM is created, go to its settings.
   - Under "Identity", enable the system-assigned managed identity.

6. **Assign Role to VM**
   - Navigate to your Storage Account.
   - Go to "Access Control (IAM)" > "Role assignments".
   - Click on "+ Add role assignment".
     - Role: Select "Storage Blob Data Owner".
     - Assign access to: "Managed Identity".
     - Select your VM and click "Save".

7. **Connect to VM**
   - SSH into your VM using the terminal.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install jq
     ```

8. **Obtain Access Token**
   - Run the following command to get an access token:
     ```bash
     access_token=$(curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.azure.com%2F' -H Metadata:true | jq -r '.access_token')
     ```

9. **Access Uploaded File**
   - Use the following command to access the uploaded file:
     ```bash
     curl "https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<blob_name>" -H "x-ms-version: 2017-11-09" -H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"
     ```
   - Replace `<storage_account_name>`, `<container_name>`, and `<blob_name>` with your actual values.



### Breakdown of Commands

1. **Access Token Command**
   ```bash
   access_token=$(curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.azure.com%2F' -H Metadata:true | jq -r '.access_token')
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This command retrieves an access token for Azure Storage using the VM's managed identity.
   - **Components:**
     - `curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?...'`: This sends an HTTP GET request to the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS), which is available at that IP address. It provides information about the VM's identity.
     - `api-version=2018-02-01`: Specifies the version of the API to use.
     - `resource=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.azure.com%2F`: Specifies the resource you want access toâ€”in this case, Azure Storage.
     - `-H Metadata:true`: This header is required to indicate that the request is coming from a VM.
     - `| jq -r '.access_token'`: The output of the curl command is piped to `jq`, which extracts the access token from the JSON response.

2. **Accessing the Blob Command**
   ```bash
   curl "https://$storage_account_name.blob.core.windows.net/$container_name/$blob_name" -H "x-ms-version: 2017-11-09" -H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This command accesses a blob (file) in your Azure Storage container using the access token obtained in the previous command.
   - **Components:**
     - `curl "https://$storage_account_name.blob.core.windows.net/$container_name/$blob_name"`: Constructs the URL to access the specific blob.
     - `$storage_account_name`, `$container_name`, `$blob_name`: These variables should be replaced with the actual names of your storage account, container, and blob.
     - `-H "x-ms-version: 2017-11-09"`: Specifies the version of the Azure Storage service to use.
     - `-H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"`: This header includes the Bearer token for authentication.

### Checking the Uploaded File

To check if the file you uploaded is accessible, you can run the access blob command (the second command above) from your VM. If you get a successful response (HTTP 200), it means your file is accessible.


# Viewing Files in Azure Storage from a Virtual Machine (VM)

There are several ways you can view the file you uploaded to your Azure Storage Account from your Virtual Machine (VM). Here are some common methods:

## 1. Using cURL
You can use the `curl` command to directly access and view the file in your terminal. For example:
```bash
curl "https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<blob_name>" -H "x-ms-version: 2017-11-09" -H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"
```
Replace `<storage_account_name>`, `<container_name>`, and `<blob_name>` with your specific details.

## 2. Using Azure CLI
If you have the Azure CLI installed on your VM, you can use the following command to download the file:
```bash
az storage blob download --account-name <storage_account_name> --container-name <container_name> --name <blob_name> --file <local_file_path>
```
This command downloads the blob to a specified local path, which you can then open.

## 3. Using Azure Storage Explorer
You can also use **Azure Storage Explorer**, a desktop application that allows you to interact with Azure Storage Accounts. You can install it on your VM, connect it to your Azure account, and easily browse, upload, or download files.

## 4. Using PowerShell
If you have PowerShell on your VM, you can use the following command:
```powershell
$context = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName <storage_account_name> -UseConnectedAccount
Get-AzStorageBlobContent -Container <container_name> -Blob <blob_name> -Destination <local_path> -Context $context
```
This command will download the blob to your specified local path.

## 5. Using a Web Browser
If your blob has public access, you can also access it via a web browser by navigating to:
```
https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<blob_name>
```
Make sure the blob's permissions allow for public access.

## 6. Using SDKs
If you're working with a specific programming language, Azure SDKs (like Python, .NET, or Java) allow you to write scripts or applications that can access and manipulate blobs programmatically.


## Conclusion
You have successfully created an Azure VM and connected it to a Storage Account using managed identities. This setup allows secure access to Azure resources without needing to manage credentials manually.
