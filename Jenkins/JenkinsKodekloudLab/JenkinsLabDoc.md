# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Lab

## Overview

This repository contains the steps and tasks completed during the Jenkins lab at KodeKloud. The lab involved setting up a Jenkins pipeline to perform a series of tasks related to CI/CD.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Install the Pipelines Plugin**
2. **Create a "Hello World" Pipeline**
3. **Clone a Git Repository and Run Tests**
4. **Build a Docker Image**
5. **Deploy the Docker Image**

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Install the Pipelines Plugin

- Open Jenkins in your web browser.
- Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
- In the **Available** tab, search for "Pipeline" and install the "Pipeline" plugin.

### 2. Create a "Hello World" Pipeline

- Click on **New Item** in the Jenkins dashboard.
- Enter a name for your pipeline (e.g., `hello-world`).
- Select **Pipeline** and click **OK**.
- In the pipeline configuration, add the following script:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World!'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Save and build the job to see the output.

### 3. Clone a Git Repository and Run Tests

- Create a new pipeline job (e.g., `go-test`).
- Add the following script:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Clone') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/kodekloudhub/go-webapp-sample.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'go test ./...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Save and build the job to execute the tests.

### 4. Build a Docker Image

- In the same pipeline (or a new one), add a stage to build a Docker image:

```groovy
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        script {
            image = docker.build("adminturneddevops/go-webapp-sample")
        }
    }
}
```

- Ensure that you have the Docker plugin installed and configured.

### 5. Deploy the Docker Image

- Add a final stage to deploy the Docker image:

```groovy
stage('Deploy') {
    steps {
        sh "docker run -p 8090:8000 -d adminturneddevops/go-webapp-sample"
    }
}
```

- Save and build the job to deploy the application.



## Useful Docker Commands

Here are some essential Docker commands that were used during the lab, along with their descriptions:

1. **List Docker Images**:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```
   - **Description**: Lists all Docker images stored on your local machine, showing their repository, tag, image ID, creation date, and size.

2. **List Running Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   - **Description**: Displays a list of all currently running Docker containers, including their container ID, image, command, creation time, status, and port mappings.

3. **View Logs of a Specific Container**:
   ```bash
   docker logs [CONTAINER_ID]
   ```
   - **Description**: Shows the logs generated by a specific container. Replace `[CONTAINER_ID]` with the actual ID of the container you want to inspect.

4. **Run a Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT] -d [IMAGE_NAME]
   ```
   - **Description**: Starts a new container from a specified image. The `-p` option maps a port on the host to a port on the container. The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode. Replace `[HOST_PORT]`, `[CONTAINER_PORT]`, and `[IMAGE_NAME]` with the desired values.

5. **Stop a Running Container**:
   ```bash
   docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]
   ```
   - **Description**: Stops a running container specified by its ID.

6. **Remove a Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker rm [CONTAINER_ID]
   ```
   - **Description**: Deletes a stopped container specified by its ID.

7. **Remove a Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker rmi [IMAGE_NAME]
   ```
   - **Description**: Removes a Docker image from your local storage. Replace `[IMAGE_NAME]` with the actual name of the image.

8. **Pull an Image from Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker pull [IMAGE_NAME]
   ```
   - **Description**: Downloads a Docker image from Docker Hub to your local machine. Replace `[IMAGE_NAME]` with the desired image.

9. **Check Docker System Status**:
   ```bash
   docker info
   ```
   - **Description**: Provides detailed information about your Docker installation, including the number of containers, images, and other system statistics.
```


## Conclusion

This lab has provided valuable insights into Jenkins and CI/CD processes & usefull docker commands.
